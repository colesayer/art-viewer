    title: "Storm and Strife",
    text: `Frankenstein’s monster met his maker and recounted all that had happened since waking up in the studio. An outcast forced to observe the world around him, he learned to forage for food as well as read. Walking in the woods he found a satchel of books containing Plutarch’s Lives, Paradise Lost, and The Sorrows of Werter. Lonely and detached, he sympathized mostly with the Devil banished from heaven and the plight of young Werter.
           Goethe first published The Sorrows of Werter in 1774. It is a story of unrequited love that ends in the protagonist’s suicide. An immediate success, it sparked what was known as The Sturm und Drang period in German Literature. Sturm und Drang, translated literally as Storm and Strife, was noted for emphasizing emotional content in opposition to the popular Enlightenment thinking of the time. Promoting a humanist confrontation with scientific rationalism, Sturm und Drang would later evolve into the Romantic period, in which we find Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein.
           Napoleon Bonaparte famously declared The Sorrows of Werter one of the greatest examples of European literature. He carried a copy in his satchel at all times during his military campaigns in Egypt. It was during this time that he learned of his beloved wife Josephine’s infidelities. Despite his military successes, Napoleon returned to Paris heartbroken, where he locked himself in his chambers and refused her company. Eventually they divorced, though Josephine would be the last word he uttered on his deathbed.`,

    text: `“It was on a dreary night that I beheld the accomplishment of my toils.”
          To which the affectionate Captain queried, “But what precisely was this accomplishment, Dr. Frankenstein? Merely a monster, or the product of the struggle with one’s self?”
          The Doctor sighed, “Perhaps, yes, in creating the monster nothing new was born, I just pulled myself apart. If only human bodies had hinges we could just splay and experience the many layers of consciousness in unison.”
          “I saw your wretched monster once, sitting against a tree in a park reading Goethe; that tragic story of love unrequited. Maybe we become the book we are reading, composed of the things we hold on to.”
          “After flipping through the pages the little waft of wind hits the face indefinitely. Suddenly everything becomes a mirror of itself. The swan is its image. The surface of the water is the swan. A couple runningcompresses, and everyone is melded to the meadow in a park. They are all that place of slow transformation. Forces are funny, vibrating invisibly all the time. We imagine we walk on the earth, but we don’t."`,
